        <p>
          Hi, I’m <strong>Waris</strong>, a passionate front-end developer who
          enjoys building clean and user-friendly web interfaces.
        </p>

        <p>
          I work mainly with <strong>React</strong>, <strong>CSS</strong> and
          modern JavaScript. I love turning designs into responsive and
          accessible websites.
        </p>

        <p>
          Currently, I’m focused on improving my skills and building real-world
          projects to grow as a developer.
